## Assignment 1
In this project we have used Flickr30K dataset, you have to implement the same project with different open source dataset. e.g - COCO dataset with captions

## Assignment 2
In this project the model has been trained on only 100 images, thus the accuracy is less. Try to improve the accuracy of the model by training the model on more than 5000 images.

## Assignment 3
Try to implement DVC tool in your project. Create a proper documentation on the changes proposed.

## Assignment 4
The image captioning project has been implemented in Tensorflow. Try to use other framework - PyTorch.

## Assignment 5
In this project AWS services were used - AWS EC2 instance, AWS ECR, AWS S3 services etc. Try to use different cloud services to deploy your app. (you can use either GCP or Microsoft Azure)
